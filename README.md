# The-Impact-of-The-Minimum-Wage-On-Other-Wages

This is the paper and code for my work on the impact of the minimum wage on other wages in the economy.
My findings suggest that as the minimum wage rises, average wages in the economy rise 
Data was processed in python and analyzed in R using the panel data package plm.

In this paper, I explore how an increase in the minimum wage impacts wages across occupations according to education levels. I hypothesize that the minimum wage will disproportionally raise wages in the bottom part of the wage distribution and have little bearing on wages in the top half. Wage adjustments are explained by how much they are influenced by the minimum wage and skill level using a fixed effects model on panel data for occupation across 45 states over 15 years that exploits state and year variation. The data shows that there is little evidence that the minimum wage has a diminishing effect across the wage distribution. The results show that wages undergo a linear shift in response to a 1% increase in the minimum wage by either increasing by .6% or decreasing 4-11%, where the upper bound of the decreasing scenario should be accepted with caution.
